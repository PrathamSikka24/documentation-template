# Performance Metrics and Reporting

Caliper provides valuable performance insights by capturing and reporting on critical metrics during benchmark executions. These metrics offer a comprehensive understanding of the target blockchain platform's capabilities.

* **Throughput:** This metric measures the number of transactions the network can process per second, indicating its processing capacity.
* **Latency:** This metric represents the time it takes for a transaction to complete, reflecting the network's responsiveness.
* **Errors:** Caliper tracks the number of errors encountered during the benchmark, providing insights into the network's stability and reliability.

Beyond pre-defined metrics, Caliper allows users to extend its functionality by:

* **Custom Metrics:** Users can define custom metrics to capture specific performance aspects relevant to their use case.
* **Configurable Reporting:** Caliper offers configuration options to tailor the reported data based on user preferences. Users can choose which metrics to report and the level of detail included in the reports.

Caliper integrates with various visualization tools, enabling users to present performance data in an easily understandable format. These tools help users analyze trends, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions about blockchain platform selection.
