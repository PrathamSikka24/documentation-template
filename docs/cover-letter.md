Mentor for Hyperledger Caliper documentation platform update mentorship

Hi Attila,

I am Pratham Sikka, an electronics engineering sophomore interested in computer science. Along with my studies, I work as a backend developer and technical writer intern at a tech content marketing organization (Infrasity).

I learned about the Hyperledger Mentorship Programme while searching for opportunities in open-source software. On my LinkedIn feed, I came across this [post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/arunsm93_how-to-apply-to-hyperledgers-annual-paid-activity-7182758511846596608-Otyr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by Arun S.M, the Vice-Chair of Hyperledger Foundation Technical Oversight Committee. I got interested in the Hyperledger mentorship after attending the meeting and that I can apply my existing skills—technical writing, curating how-to guides, and documentation—to Blockchain, Web3, and related fields that are expected to experience significant growth in the coming years. I am particularly very interested in how this space is evolving, and I think creating simplistic documentation will assist me in making my basics very strong at the grassroots level.

As a backend developer and technical writer intern at Infrasity, I have gained meaningful experience creating concise and user-friendly documentation for the software projects we built, specifically for the technical writing clients we onboarded. I write technical blogs keeping Search Engine Optimization in mind, focusing on including longtail keywords and ensuring that words with high search volume are added. They have resulted in the documentation and guides we wrote having an SEO score of 75-80 or even more. Search for “cerbos authorization blogs,” and our blog [A Complete Guide to Next.js Authorization](https://www.cerbos.dev/blog/a-complete-guide-to-next-js-authorization) will appear at the top. So, the articles I curate gain more traction and impact a larger developer audience. I have the exact skills required for this mentorship and have the same prerequisite experience required in the duties I will fulfill during this mentorship.

To be very honest, I hope to gain credibility and learn from this mentorship experience. To elaborate, a prestigious open-source project, Hyperledger, will increase my credibility as a budding technocrat. Being a part of LFX also adds value to my profile as a developer and will help me in the long run as far as my career is concerned. Secondly, I plan to explore Web 3.0, DeFi, and other decentralized blockchain-based domains and wish to add value to this space in the years to come; this opportunity will help me understand how this space operates on a macro and a micro level. I think explaining it in the form of documentation is the best way to understand the theoretical aspect of it. As Prof. Richard P. Feynman said, “If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it. The best way to learn is to teach.” Making clear, concise, and simple documentation will give me a crystal clear understanding of blockchain technology. This is what I hope to gain from this mentorship.

In conclusion, I am excited about the opportunity to participate in the Hyperledger Mentorship program. My skills, experience, and enthusiasm make me a strong candidate for this project. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to working together to advance the goals of the Hyperledger community.

Sincerely,  
Pratham Sikka
